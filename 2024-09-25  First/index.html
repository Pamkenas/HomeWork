  <h3>About a car</h3>
  <p>
    The McLaren P1 (codenamed P12)[3] is a flagship sports car produced by British marque McLaren Automotive. Styled by
    American car designer Frank Stephenson, it is the second installment in McLaren's Ultimate Series after the McLaren
    F1. Considered to be the spiritual successor to the F1, the P1 was one of the first high performance sports cars to
    be introduced incorporating hybrid technology; the Porsche 918 Spyder having begun taking orders prior to the P1 and
    the LaFerrari introduced alongside it. First shown as a concept on the 20th anniversary of the F1 at the 2012 Paris
    Motor Show,[7] the P1 made its debut at the 2013 Geneva International Motor Show.[8][9]
